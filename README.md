Here's a high-level pseudocode to implement the above steps:

1. Read the input file
2. Determine the theater hours of operation for the given day
3. For each movie:
      a. Calculate the available time slots for the movie
      b. Schedule the movie in a way that maximizes prime-time evening hours
      c. Update the available time slots for other movies based on the scheduled showtime
4. Format and display the showtimes for each movie
